Peter's Simple Dotfile repo
-----
This repo exists to hold Peter's dotfiles and related public stuff.
No private data or keys should exist in this repo.
Small scripts are contained in the bin folder.

Q: Why not use a bare repo?

A: I want to be deliberate when including changes from other systems. Not every change on a local system should go into git.
